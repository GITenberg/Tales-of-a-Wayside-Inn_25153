<h3>THE WAYSIDE INN.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One Autumn night, in Sudbury town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the meadows bare and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The windows of the wayside inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woodbine, hanging from the eaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their crimson curtains rent and thin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As ancient is this hostelry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any in the land may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built in the old Colonial day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men lived in a grander way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ampler hospitality;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now somewhat fallen to decay,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With weather-stains upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stairways worn, and crazy doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And creaking and uneven floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chimneys huge, and tiled and tall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A region of repose it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A place of slumber and of dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote among the wooded hills!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there no noisy railway speeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But noon and night, the panting teams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop under the great oaks, that throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tangles of light and shade below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On roofs and doors and window-sills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the road the barns display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lines of stalls, their mows of hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the wide doors the breezes blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wattled cocks strut to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, half effaced by rain and shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Red Horse prances on the sign.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Round this old-fashioned, quaint abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep silence reigned, save when a gust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went rushing down the county road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skeletons of leaves, and dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment quickened by its breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuddered and danced their dance of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the ancient oaks o'erhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious voices moaned and fled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But from the parlor of the inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasant murmur smote the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like water rushing through a weir;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft interrupted by the din<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of laughter and of loud applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in each intervening pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music of a violin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire-light, shedding over all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendor of its ruddy glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled the whole parlor large and low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It gleamed on wainscot and on wall,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It touched with more than wonted grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Princess Mary's pictured face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bronzed the rafters overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the old spinet's ivory keys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It played inaudible melodies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It crowned the sombre clock with flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hands, the hours, the maker's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And painted with a livelier red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Landlord's coat-of-arms again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, flashing on the window-pane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblazoned with its light and shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jovial rhymes, that still remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writ near a century ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the great Major Molineaux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Hawthorne has immortal made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before the blazing fire of wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect the rapt musician stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever and anon he bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head upon his instrument,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to listen, till he caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confessions of its secret thought,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy, the triumph, the lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The exultation and the pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, by the magic of his art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He soothed the throbbings of its heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lulled it into peace again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Around the fireside at their ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sat a group of friends, entranced<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the belfry-chamber overhead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On a shadowy something far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the river widens to meet the bay,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A second lamp in the belfry burns!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br /></span>

<h2>THE STUDENT'S TALE.</h2>


<h3>THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One summer morning, when the sun was hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary with labor in his garden-plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ser Federigo sat among the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a huge vine, that, with its arms outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung its delicious clusters overhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below him, through the lovely valley, flowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river Arno, like a winding road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from its banks were lifted high in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spires and roofs of Florence called the Fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him a marble tomb, that rose above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wasted fortunes and his buried love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there, in banquet and in tournament,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His wealth had lavished been, his substance spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To woo and lose, since ill his wooing sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monna Giovanna, who his rival wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ideal woman of a young man's dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he withdrew, in poverty and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this small farm, the last of his domain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only comfort and his only care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prune his vines, and plant the fig and pear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only forester and only guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His falcon, faithful to him, when the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose willing hands had found so light of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen knocker of his palace door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companion of his solitary ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purveyor of his feasts on holidays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On him this melancholy man bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love with which his nature overflowed.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And so the empty-handed years went round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vacant, though voiceful with prophetic sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, that summer morn, he sat and mused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folded, patient hands, as he was used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dreamily before his half-closed sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated the vision of his lost delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him, motionless, the drowsy bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamed of the chase, and in his slumber heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sudden, scythe-like sweep of wings, that dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The headlong plunge thro' eddying gulfs of air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, starting broad awake upon his perch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tinkled his bells, like mass-bells in a church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking at his master, seemed to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ser Federigo, shall we hunt to-day?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ser Federigo thought not of the chase;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender vision of her lovely face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not say he seems to see, he sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the leaf-shadows of the trellises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself, yet not herself; a lovely child<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With flowing tresses, and eyes wide and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming undaunted up the garden walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking not at him, but at the hawk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Beautiful falcon!" said he, "would that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might hold thee on my wrist, or see thee fly!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice was hers, and made strange echoes start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the haunted chambers of his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As an &aelig;olian harp through gusty doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some old ruin its wild music pours.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who is thy mother, my fair boy?" he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand laid softly on that shining head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Monna Giovanna.&mdash;Will you let me stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while, and with your falcon play?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We live there, just beyond your garden wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great house behind the poplars tall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he spake on; and Federigo heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from afar each softly uttered word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drifted onward through the golden gleams<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And shadows of the misty sea of dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mariners becalmed through vapors drift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear far off the mournful breakers roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And voices calling faintly from the shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, waking from his pleasant reveries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the little boy upon his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him stories of his gallant bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till in their friendship he became a third.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Monna Giovanna, widowed in her prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had come with friends to pass the summer time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her grand villa, half-way up the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erlooking Florence, but retired and still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron gates, that opened through long lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred ilex and centennial pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terraced gardens, and broad steps of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sylvan deities, with moss o'ergrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fountains palpitating in the heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all Val d'Arno stretched beneath its feet.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Here in seclusion, as a widow may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely lady whiled the hours away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing in sable robes the statued hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself the stateliest statue among all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeing more and more, with secret joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband risen and living in her boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the lost sense of life returned again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not as delight, but as relief from pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the boy, rejoicing in his strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stormed down the terraces from length to length;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And climbed the garden trellises for fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his chief pastime was to watch the flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a gerfalcon, soaring into sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then downward stooping at some distant call;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he gazed full often wondered he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who might the master of the falcon be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until that happy morning, when he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master and falcon in the cottage ground.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now a shadow and a terror fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the great house, as if a passing-bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tolled from the tower, and filled each spacious room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With secret awe, and preternatural gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The petted boy grew ill, and day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pined with mysterious malady away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother's heart would not be comforted;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her darling seemed to her already dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often, sitting by the sufferer's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What can I do to comfort thee?" she cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first the silent lips made no reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, moved at length by her importunate cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give me," he answered, with imploring tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ser Federigo's falcon for my own!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No answer could the astonished mother make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could she ask, e'en for her darling's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such favor at a luckless lover's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well knowing that to ask was to command?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Well knowing, what all falconers confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the land that falcon was the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master's pride and passion and delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet, for her child's sake, she could no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than give assent, to soothe his restlessness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So promised, and then promising to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her promise sacred, saw him fall asleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morrow was a bright September morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth was beautiful as if new-born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was that nameless splendor everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wild exhilaration in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes the passers in the city street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Congratulate each other as they meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two lovely ladies, clothed in cloak and hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed through the garden gate into the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the lustrous leaves, and through the sheen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dewy sunshine showering down between.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The one, close-hooded, had the attractive grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman's face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other with her hood thrown back, her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making a golden glory in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her young heart singing louder than the thrush.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So walked, that morn, through mingled light and shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each by the other's presence lovelier made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent upon their errand and its end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They found Ser Federigo at his toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like banished Adam, delving in the soil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he looked and these fair women spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garden suddenly was glorified;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His long-lost Eden was restored again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the strange river winding through the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer was the Arno to his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Euphrates watering Paradise!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Monna Giovanna raised her stately head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with fair words of salutation said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ser Federigo, we come here as friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping in this to make some poor amends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For past unkindness. I who ne'er before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would even cross the threshold of your door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who in happier days such pride maintained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refused your banquets, and your gifts disdained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This morning come, a self-invited guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To put your generous nature to the test,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breakfast with you under your own vine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which he answered: "Poor desert of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not your unkindness call it, for if aught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is good in me of feeling or of thought,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From you it comes, and this last grace outweighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sorrows, all regrets of other days."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And after further compliment and talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the dahlias in the garden walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his guests; and to his cottage turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he entered for a moment yearned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the lost splendors of the days of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruby glass, the silver and the gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt how piercing is the sting of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By want embittered and intensified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked about him for some means or way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep this unexpected holiday;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searched every cupboard, and then searched again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned the maid, who came, but came in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Signor did not hunt to-day," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There's nothing in the house but wine and bread."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little bells, with that sagacious look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which said, as plain as language to the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If anything is wanting, I am here!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, everything is wanting, gallant bird!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master seized thee without further word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thine own lure, he whirled thee round; ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pomp and flutter of brave falconry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bells, the jesses, the bright scarlet hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flight and the pursuit o'er field and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these forevermore are ended now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer victor, but the victim thou!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fragrant peach, the juicy bergamot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ser Federigo, would not these suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When all was ready, and the courtly dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her companion to the cottage came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon Ser Federigo's brain there fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild enchantment of a magic spell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The room they entered, mean and low and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rustic chair she sat on was a throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate celestial food, and a divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flavor was given to his country wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poor falcon, fragrant with his spice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peacock was, or bird of paradise!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the repast was ended, they arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed again into the garden-close.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then said the lady, "Far too well I know,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your falcon, your sole comfort and delight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I deemed that nothing worthier could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than what most dear and precious was to me,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In mute contrition, mingled with dismay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grieving that he such sacrifice should make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kill his falcon for a woman's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet feeling in her heart a woman's pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nothing she could ask for was denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then took her leave, and passed out at the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With footstep slow and soul disconsolate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three days went by, and lo! a passing-bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tolled from the little chapel in the dell;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Breathing a prayer, "Alas! her child is dead!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Three months went by; and lo! a merrier chime<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ser Federigo sat beside its door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, with servitors to do his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the grand villa, half-way up the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat at the Christmas feast, and at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monna Giovanna, his beloved bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never so beautiful, so kind, so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enthroned once more in the old rustic chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-perched upon the back of which there stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image of a falcon carved in wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath the inscription, with a date,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All things come round to him who will but wait."<br /></span>

<h2>THE SPANISH JEW'S TALE.</h2>


<h3>THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rabbi Ben Levi, on the Sabbath, read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A volume of the Law, in which it said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No man shall look upon my face and live."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he read, he prayed that God would give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful servant grace with mortal eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look upon His face and yet not die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then fell a sudden shadow on the page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lifting up his eyes, grown dim with age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the Angel of Death before him stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding a naked sword in his right hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling voice he said, "What wilt thou here?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angel answered, "Lo! the time draws near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou must die; yet first, by God's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er thou askest shall be granted thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied the Rabbi, "Let these living eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First look upon my place in Paradise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then said the Angel, "Come with me and look."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising, and uplifting his gray head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give me thy sword," he to the Angel said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angel smiled and hastened to obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then led him forth to the Celestial Town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set him on the wall, whence, gazing down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rabbi Ben Levi, with his living eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might look upon his place in Paradise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then straight into the city of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Rabbi leaped with the Death-Angel's sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the streets there swept a sudden breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of something there unknown, which men call death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the Angel stayed without, and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come back!" To which the Rabbi's voice replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No! in the name of God, whom I adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swear that hence I will depart no more!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then all the Angels cried, "O Holy One,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See what the son of Levi here has done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingdom of Heaven he takes by violence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Thy name refuses to go hence!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord replied, "My Angels, be not wroth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did e'er the son of Levi break his oath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him remain; for he with mortal eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall look upon my face and yet not die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the outer wall the Angel of Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the great voice, and said, with panting breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give back the sword, and let me go my way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the Rabbi paused, and answered, "Nay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anguish enough already has it caused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the sons of men." And while he paused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the awful mandate of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounding through the air, "Give back the sword!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said he to the dreadful Angel, "Swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No human eye shall look on it again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when thou takest away the souls of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself unseen, and with an unseen sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt perform the bidding of the Lord."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Angel took the sword again, and swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walks on earth unseen forevermore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He ended: and a kind of spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the silent listeners fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His solemn manner and his words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had touched the deep, mysterious chords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That vibrate in each human breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike, but not alike confessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spiritual world seemed near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close above them, full of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its awful adumbration passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A luminous shadow, vague and vast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They almost feared to look, lest there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embodied from the impalpable air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At last, but in a voice subdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to disturb their dreamy mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the Sicilian: "While you spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telling your legend marvellous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly in my memory woke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought of one, now gone from us,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old Abate, meek and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend and teacher, when a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sometimes in those days of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The legend of an Angel told,<br /></span>

<h2>THE SICILIAN'S TALE.</h2>


<h3>KING ROBERT OF SICILY.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apparelled in magnificent attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With retinue of many a knight and squire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the priests chant the Magnificat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he listened, o'er and o'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated, like a burden or refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caught the words, "<i>Deposuit potentes</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>De sede, et exaltavit humiles</i>";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly lifting up his kingly head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to a learned clerk beside him said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What mean these words?" The clerk made answer meet,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"He has put down the mighty from their seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has exalted them of low degree."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis well that such seditious words are sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For unto priests and people be it known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no power can push me from my throne!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he awoke, it was already night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church was empty, and there was no light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted a little space before some saint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He started from his seat and gazed around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But saw no living thing and heard no sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groped towards the door, but it was locked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And imprecations upon men and saints.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the sexton, hearing from without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tumult of the knocking and the shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with his lantern, asking, "Who is there?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Open: 'tis I, the King! Art thou afraid?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man rushed by him at a single stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But leaped into the blackness of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanished like a spectre from his sight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Despoiled of his magnificent attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right and left each seneschal and page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last he reached the banquet-room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazing with light, and breathing with perfume.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There on the dais sat another king,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">King Robert's self in features, form, and height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all transfigured with angelic light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was an Angel; and his presence there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a divine effulgence filled the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An exaltation, piercing the disguise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though none the hidden Angel recognize.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who met his looks of anger and surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the divine compassion of his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said, "Who art thou? and why com'st thou here?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which King Robert answered, with a sneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am the King, and come to claim my own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly, at these audacious words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, not the King, but the King's Jester, thou<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A group of tittering pages ran before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they opened wide the folding-door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the mock plaudits of "Long live the King!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said within himself, "It was a dream!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the straw rustled as he turned his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were the cap and bells beside his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the corner, a revolting shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was no dream; the world he loved so much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Days came and went; and now returned again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the Angel's governance benign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy island danced with corn and wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep within the mountain's burning breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enceladus, the giant, was at rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sullen and silent and disconsolate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks bewildered and a vacant stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only friend the ape, his only food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What others left,&mdash;he still was unsubdued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Angel met him on his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half in earnest, half in jest, would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou the King?" the passion of his woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst from him in resistless overflow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty answer back, "I am, I am the King!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Almost three years were ended; when there came<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ambassadors of great repute and name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By letter summoned them forthwith to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angel with great joy received his guests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave them presents of embroidered vests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,<br /></span>

<h2>THE THEOLOGIAN'S TALE.</h2>


<h3>TORQUEMADA.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the heroic days when Ferdinand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Isabella ruled the Spanish land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Torquemada, with his subtle brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruled them, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a great castle near Valladolid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moated and high and by fair woodlands hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt, as from the chronicles we learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old Hidalgo proud and taciturn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose name has perished, with his towers of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his actions save this one alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This one, so terrible, perhaps 'twere best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it, too, were forgotten with the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless, perchance, our eyes can see therein<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The martyrdom triumphant o'er the sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A double picture, with its gloom and glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendor overhead, the death below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This sombre man counted each day as lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which his feet no sacred threshold crossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he chanced the passing Host to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft he confessed; and with each mutinous thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with wild beasts at Ephesus, he fought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked in processions, with his head down bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only pastime was to hunt the boar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with his jingling mules to hurry down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jews were burned, or banished from the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The demon whose delight is to destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook him, and shouted with a trumpet tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, in that old castle in the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughters, in the dawn of womanhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning from their convent school, had made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resplendent with their bloom the forest shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reminding him of their dead mother's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first she came into that gloomy place,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A memory in his heart as dim and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As moonlight in a solitary street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the same rays, that lift the sea, are thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely but powerless upon walls of stone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
<span class="i0">These two fair daughters of a mother dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all the dream had left him as it fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A joy at first, and then a growing care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a voice within him cried, "Beware!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vague presentiment of impending doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ghostly footsteps in a vacant room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunted him day and night; a formless fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That death to some one of his house was near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dark surmises of a hidden crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made life itself a death before its time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jealous, suspicious, with no sense of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spy upon his daughters he became;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With velvet slippers, noiseless on the floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He glided softly through half-open doors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the room, and now upon the stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood beside them ere they were aware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He listened in the passage when they talked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watched them from the casement when they walked,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the gypsy haunt the river's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, tortured by the mystery and the doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some dark secret, past his finding out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baffled he paused; then reassured again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued the flying phantom of his brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watched them even when they knelt in church;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, descending lower in his search,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioned the servants, and with eager eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened incredulous to their replies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gypsy? none had seen her in the wood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monk? a mendicant in search of food!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the awful revelation came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crushing at once his pride of birth and name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopes his yearning bosom forward cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ancestral glories of the past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All fell together, crumbling in disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A turret rent from battlement to base.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His daughters talking in the dead of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their own chamber, and without a light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening, as he was wont, he overheard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learned the dreadful secret, word by word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurrying from his castle, with a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised his hands to the unpitying sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeating one dread word, till bush and tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught it, and shuddering answered, "Heresy!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wrapped in his cloak, his hat drawn o'er his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hurrying forward, now with lingering pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked all night the alleys of his park,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one unseen companion in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Demon who within him lay in wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his presence turned his love to hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever muttering in an undertone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the morrow, after early Mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet the dew was glistening on the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the woods were musical with birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old Hidalgo, uttering fearful words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked homeward with the Priest, and in his room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned his trembling daughters to their doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When questioned, with brief answers they replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor when accused evaded or denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expostulations, passionate appeals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that the human heart most fears or feels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the Priest with earnest voice essayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the father threatened, wept, and prayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last he said, with haughty mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Holy Office, then, must intervene!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now the Grand Inquisitor of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the fifty horsemen of his train,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His awful name resounding, like the blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of funeral trumpets, as he onward passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to Valladolid, and there began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To harry the rich Jews with fire and ban.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him the Hidalgo went, and at the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demanded audience on affairs of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a secret chamber stood before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A venerable graybeard of fourscore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed in the hood and habit of a friar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his hand the mystic horn he held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which poison and all noxious charms dispelled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard in silence the Hidalgo's tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then answered in a voice that made him quail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Son of the Church! when Abraham of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sacrifice his only son was told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not pause to parley nor protest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hastened to obey the Lord's behest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him it was accounted righteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Holy Church expects of thee no less!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred frenzy seized the father's brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mercy from that hour implored in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! who will e'er believe the words I say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughters he accused, and the same day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They both were cast into the dungeon's gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dismal antechamber of the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arraigned, condemned, and sentenced to the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret torture and the public shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then to the Grand Inquisitor once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hidalgo went, more eager than before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "When Abraham offered up his son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clave the wood wherewith it might be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his example taught, let me too bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wood from the forest for my offering!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep voice, without a pause, replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Son of the Church! by faith now justified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete thy sacrifice, even as thou wilt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Church absolves thy conscience from all guilt!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then this most wretched father went his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the woods, that round his castle lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once his daughters in their childhood played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their young mother in the sun and shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now all the leaves had fallen; the branches bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made a perpetual moaning in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And screaming from their eyries overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ravens sailed athwart the sky of lead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his own hands he lopped the boughs and bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fagots, that crackled with foreboding sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his mules, caparisoned and gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bells and tassels, sent them on their way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then with his mind on one dark purpose bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again to the Inquisitor he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "Behold, the fagots I have brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, lest my atonement be as naught,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grant me one more request, one last desire,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my own hand to light the funeral fire!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Torquemada answered from his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Son of the Church! Thine offering is complete;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her servants through all ages shall not cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To magnify thy deed. Depart in peace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon the market-place, builded of stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scaffold rose, whereon Death claimed his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the four corners, in stern attitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four statues of the Hebrew Prophets stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing with calm indifference in their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this place of human sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round which was gathering fast the eager crowd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The church-bells tolled, the chant of monks drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A line of torches smoked along the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a stir, a rush, a tramp of feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with its banners floating in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the long procession crossed the square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to the statues of the Prophets bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victims stood, with fagots piled around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the air a blast of trumpets shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And louder sang the monks with bell and book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Hidalgo, lofty, stern, and proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted his torch, and, bursting through the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted in haste the fagots, and then fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They saw the figure of that cruel knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lean from a window in the turret's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ghastly face illumined with the glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands upraised above his head in prayer,<br /></span>

<h3>THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the season, when through all the land<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The merle and mavis build, and building sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those lovely lyrics, written by His hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom Saxon C&aelig;dmon calls the Blithe-heart King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the boughs the purple buds expand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The banners of the vanguard of the Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rivulets, rejoicing, rush and leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wave their fluttering signals from the steep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The robin and the blue-bird, piping loud,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sparrows chirped as if they still were proud<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their race in Holy Writ should mentioned be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hungry crows assembled in a crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Clamored their piteous prayer incessantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing who hears the ravens cry, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give us, O Lord, this day our daily bread!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Across the Sound the birds of passage sailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Speaking some unknown language strange and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tropic isle remote, and passing hailed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The village with the cheers of all their fleet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or quarrelling together, laughed and railed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like foreign sailors, landed in the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seaport town, and with outlandish noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of oaths and gibberish frightening girls and boys.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That mingled with the universal mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cassandra-like, prognosticating woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shook their heads, and doomed with dreadful words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To swift destruction the whole race of birds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<h2>THE CUMBERLAND.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At anchor in Hampton Roads we lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On board of the Cumberland, sloop-of-war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at times from the fortress across the bay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The alarum of drums swept past,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or a bugle blast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the camp on the shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then far away to the south uprose<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A little feather of snow-white smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we knew that the iron ship of our foes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was steadily steering its course<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To try the force<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of our ribs of oak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Down upon us heavily runs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Silent and sullen, the floating fort;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then comes a puff of smoke from her guns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And leaps the terrible death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With fiery breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From each open port.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are not idle, but send her straight<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Defiance back in a full broadside!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hail rebounds from a roof of slate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rebounds our heavier hail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From each iron scale<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of the monster's hide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Strike your flag!" the rebel cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In his arrogant old plantation strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Never!" our gallant Morris replies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"It is better to sink than to yield!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the whole air pealed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the cheers of our men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a kraken huge and black,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She crushed our ribs in her iron grasp!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down went the Cumberland all a wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a sudden shudder of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the cannon's breath<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For her dying gasp.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next morn, as the sun rose over the bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still floated our flag at the mainmast-head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, how beautiful was thy day!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every waft of the air<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was a whisper of prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or a dirge for the dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ho! brave hearts that went down in the seas!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ye are at peace in the troubled stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! brave land! with hearts like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy flag, that is rent in twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall be one again,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And without a seam!<br /></span>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
